**The Project Goals**
---------------------

       1. Detection and localization of different symbols present in a P&ID.  

          List of symbols which majorly fall in these categories:

              -- Line symbols

              -- Valve symbols

              -- Piping symbols (tees, flanges, reducers, etc)

              -- Pumps symbols

              -- Vessels symbols

              -- Tanks symbols

              -- Instrumentation symbols

    2. Use of OCR for detection of Tag numbers and then associating them with their respective symbols.

    3. Detection of lines that correspond to Pipes and Cables. Mapping them with their LineID number.
